# gym-socialgame
OpenAI Gym environment for a social game.

## Usage
This environment can be directly plugged into existing OpenAI-Gym compatible RL libraries (e.g. [Stable Baselines](https://stable-baselines.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html)).
For this case, try the following:
    
    pip install -e .

Otherwise, this package can be used as a standalone environment for other RL algorithms.
